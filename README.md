***

### Source Files 
1. main.cpp   = The main function. It exceutes all tests in the project.
2. Point.h    = Contains the class definitions of class point.
3. Point.cpp  = Defines and implements the class point (represents a point in multidimensional Euclidean space).
4. Cluster.h  = Contains the class definitions of class cluster (a collection of 'point' objects).
5. Cluster.cpp= Defines and implements the class cluster.
